# Stratos

This is a project that I wanted to do for sometime. It's basically a somewhat aestethic glassmorphism focused weather dashboard, which requires both the latitude and logitude to retrieve the relevant data and display it on the page.
It has some dynamic images to make it look more active and cool looking.

It was made using React, Vite, PrimeReact, Gsap, ChartJs and day-fns
